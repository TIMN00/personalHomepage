# My Personal HomePage, Portfolio, and Blog

React + NextJS 13, with a V3 Sanity IO Studio-embedded backend CMS into the app.

### Process

Created during a weekend #papafam code-along, whom I have to thank for the lucid NextJS tutorial, the clean tailwind css layout, and nifty tips for getting the Sanity plugins/previews to work.

### Useful tips and tricks such as: 

the Sanity IO studio preview mode package/components, using the React Portable Text package for rich text parsing, and gaining familiarity with the SSR (static site regeneration) to create static sites from Sanity post slugs.  

####
So pleased with the almost live-streaming like capabilities of the blog post updated with the static site generation, I have decided to deploy this MVP to my own homepage and hope to continue to build on it from here. Thanks!
