# My Personal HomePage, Portfolio, and Blog

React + NextJS 13, with a V3 Sanity IO Studio-embedded backend CMS into the app.

## Deploy your own

Created during a weekend code-along with #papafam, where I was inspired by the clean tailwind css layout and was able to glean 

###
useful tips and tricks such as: 

the Sanity IO studio preview mode package/components, using the React Portable Text package for rich text parsing, and gaining familiarity with the SSR (static site regeneration) to create static sites from Sanity post slugs.  

# So pleased with the almost live-streaming like capabilities of the blog post updated with the static site generation, I have decided to deploy to my own homepage. Thanks!
